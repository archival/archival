#Archival vocabulary

An OWL/RDF vocabulary for describing archival collections and the names associated with them.  This vocabulary is a work in progress and is currently being used as a catch-all for creating classes and properties for concepts and relationships that don't exist in other vocabularies.

The vocabulary URI is http://purl.org/archival/vocab/arch#
